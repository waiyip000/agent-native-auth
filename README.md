# Agent-Native Challenge Protocol (ANCP)

Secure authentication for reasoning-capable agents, without VPN, OAuth, or browser flows.

## 🚀 What is ANCP?

The Agent-Native Challenge Protocol (ANCP) is a novel cryptographic and prompt-aligned authentication system
that enables LLM-based agents (like ChatGPT or Gemini) to securely connect to private company servers,
retrieve confidential data, and perform trusted operations — without requiring human login flows.

## 🔐 Key Benefits

- Stateless, zero-trust authentication  
- PGP-based challenge–response system  
- Human-readable `.well-known/ancp.discovery.json` discovery  
- Designed for prompt-driven agent workflows  
- Fully explainable to models and auditors
