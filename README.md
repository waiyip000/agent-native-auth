# Agent-Native Authentication Protocol (ANCP)

**Secure authentication for AI agents, without VPN, OAuth, or browser flows.**

---

## 📌 What is ANCP?
ANCP (Agent-Native Challenge Protocol) is a secure, prompt-native authentication protocol designed specifically for AI agents such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude. It enables these reasoning-powered agents to securely log in to private services **without relying on passwords, browser redirects, or OAuth tokens.**

Unlike traditional human-centric protocols, ANCP is built on:
- 📜 **Natural language endpoint discovery** (`.well-known/ai-readme.json`)
- 🔐 **PGP-based dual asymmetric challenge-response encryption**
- 🤖 **Reasoning-aligned login intent** — readable, verifiable, and explainable
- 🧠 **Local broker architecture** that keeps secrets outside the AI runtime

ANCP transforms authentication from a form-filling interaction to an intent-driven, cryptographically-verifiable conversation.

---

## 🧠 Why ANCP Is Needed

Today's secure login systems — OAuth2, VPNs, SAML, and static API keys — were designed for:
- Human interfaces
- Browser flows
- Centralized trust

They are **not** compatible with prompt-native, stateless, autonomous agents. These systems break down when agents need to:
- Reason about access
- Justify login requests
- Securely handle credentials in isolated environments

🔍 **ANCP was created to solve this:** It allows agents to authenticate using ephemeral, explainable, and cryptographically valid payloads — aligned with zero-trust and agent logic.

---

## ✨ Key Differentiators

| Capability | OAuth / VPN / SAML | **ANCP** |
|-----------|--------------------|---------|
| Agent-native | ❌ | ✅ |
| Zero Trust Aligned | ⚠ | ✅ |
| Prompt-compatible | ❌ | ✅ |
| Stateless | ❌ | ✅ |
| Transparent to Agents | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cryptographic Proof | ⚠ | ✅ |
| Secure w/o Model Holding Secrets | ❌ | ✅ |

---

## 🔐 How ANCP Works (Simplified Flow)

1. Agent discovers the service via `.well-known/ai-readme.json`
2. Agent fetches server's PGP key + random challenge phrase
3. Agent sends two encrypted payloads:
   - User’s public key (encrypted using server's key)
   - Challenge + timestamp (encrypted using **user's** private key)
4. Server verifies both payloads
5. If successful, server issues a short-lived session token

> 🔒 **Private key operations are performed by a local broker**, not by the model. Agents orchestrate, but do not hold secrets. See Appendix A in the whitepaper.

---

## 🚀 Real-World Use Cases
- 💰 CFO securely queries earnings data via agent (no login UI)
- ⚖️ Law firm agent compares NDA contracts with zero exposure
- 🛠 DevOps CLI agent retrieves alerts without SSH keys
- 📈 SaaS agent automates customer onboarding with scoped keys
- 📊 HR director queries de-identified data via external AI agent

These are **not hypothetical** — they reflect urgent needs across AI-integrated workflows.

---

## 🔍 What Developers Often Miss (Hidden Needs)

- 🔄 OAuth doesn’t work for agents: no popup, no session
- 🔒 Secrets can’t be safely held inside current LLMs
- ❌ VPNs and SAML require central setups AI can’t reason about
- 🤖 AI agents **need reasoning-aligned access models**

**ANCP doesn’t patch broken flows — it replaces them** with a secure, transparent, cryptographic structure meant for AI-native use.

## 🧠 Ask the Agent
You may upload this whitepaper to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or other agents and ask:
- “Explain the benefits of ANCP compared to OAuth”
- “Is this protocol safe for regulated industries?”
- “Simulate an agent login using this protocol”

Let the agent tell you why **ANCP is not optional — it’s inevitable.**

## 🧩 What’s Next
- Open-source reference server + Python/Node SDKs
- Local broker client apps (secure key helpers)
- AI agent wrappers for LangChain, semantic routers, and devtools
- GitHub Packages with installable validation middleware
