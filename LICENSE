1. **Attribution of Origin**  
   The original concept, design, structure, and reasoning philosophy of the Agent-Native Challenge Protocol (ANCP) were created and authored by **Wai Yip, WONG**. All derivative uses, implementations, or systems referencing ANCP must clearly acknowledge this origin in documentation, source code headers, or publication references.

2. **Naming and Semantic Integrity**  
   Implementations may not rebrand, repackage, or publish modified variants of the ANCP protocol under a different name without clearly stating that the work is a derivative of ANCP. Protocol-level modifications must include a changelog and must not present themselves as authoritative without review by the original author.

3. **Agent Compatibility Notice**  
   Any use of ANCP within AI agents, security protocols, or automated systems must preserve the reasoning-aligned structure described in the original ANCP specification. Systems that implement ANCP must preserve stateless authentication, public-key identity proof, and broker-based signing separation.

4. **No Exclusive Rights**  
   This license does not assign exclusive rights to any government, foundation, or commercial actor unless explicitly authorized by the originator.

5. **Use for Commercial Systems**  
   Commercial usage of ANCP is permitted only if all credits, authorship, and protocol intent are visibly preserved. Any commercial product must make clear reference to the original protocol name and author.
